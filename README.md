I know, i know - "everytime someone creates a to-do list app, a puppy dies" but this To do App has more to it. It's a solution challenge from Frontend Mentor
My take on the challenge is a fully-responsive, mobile-first site with HTML, CSS and vanilla-Javascript.
The user is able to navigate between Day and Night mode, check, and delete completed items off their list. They are also able to filter between active and completed items on their list. Here are the Javascript methods implemented to make that happen:

* addEventListener()
* querySelector()
* Switch statements
* appendChild()
* createElement()
* classList
* Custom functions.

I have included some psuedo code for easier understanding.
